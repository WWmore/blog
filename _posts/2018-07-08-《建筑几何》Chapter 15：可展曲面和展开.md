### Developable surface and unfoldings
> - Developable surfaces behave just like paper if we bend or twist them without tearing or stretching.

### Surfaces that can be built from paper 能由纸张建造的曲面
> - Developable surfaces S are characterized by the property that they can be mapped isometrically into the plane.
> - Developable surface has the same Gaussian curvature as the plane (i.e., it has vanishing Gaussian curvature).
> - Any ruling of such a developable ruled surface must be a **torsal ruling** R. This means that the surface S has the same tangent plane at all points of the same ruling R.
> - Three basic types: cylinders, cones, and tangent surfaces of space curves.

> - cylinders, cones, tangent surfaces of space curves) have the following common properties: They are special ruled surfaces because a tangent plane is always tangent to the surface along an entire ruling and not just in a single point. We call such surfaces **developable ruled surfaces**.
> - Moreover, the surfaces have vanishing Gaussian curvature because their spherical Gaussian image is just a curve. Therefore, a developable surface contains **only parabolic surface points** or **flat points**.
> - Thus, the offset surface Sd is also a developable surface.
> - The offset surfaces of a cone are in general not cones!
> - Surfaces of constant slope are developable.
