### Geometry for digital recontruction
> - There are two general approaches to capturing physical form.
> - One is the use of a **tracking arm**, especially suitable for capturing strings of **point data** from selected feature curves. 捕获挑选的特征曲线上的点云
> - The other method uses a laser range scanner and results in a large number of more or less **regularly distributed measurement points** from the surface of the given physical model. 从曲面上获取近乎正则分散的点云
> - Finally, all of these point clouds have to be merged into a single combined point cloud represented in the same coordinate system. This procedure is called **registration**.

### Data acquisition and registration 数据获取和匹配
> - Digitizer arms. The method is very well suited to capturing particular selected features of a model.

> - Optical scanning devices: Near-range scanners, measure objects of a size less than a few meters.
> -  Medium- and long-range scanners, when the distance between scanner and object exceeds 2 meters.

### The polygon phase 多边形阶段

> - Two-dimensional Delaunay triangulation.
> - The Delaunay triangulation joins exactly those points from the input set p1,
p2, ..., pN by an edge whose Voronoi cells share a common edge.

Hole filling requires the specification of part of the triangulation around the detected hole.

### Segmentation 分割
> - A feature region is defined as one with a significant difference in the principal curvatures (i.e., with a small principal curvature in feature direction and a high one across the feature).

### Surface fitting 曲面拟合
> - plane, sphere, cone, and cylinder exhibit only simple surfaces. These shapes are not only rather easy to detect automatically but approximations of them are not difficult to compute within the detected surface class

### The surfaces need to be build 需被建造的曲面
> -  for applications in architecture it may be better to sacrifice some accuracy and try to approximate the measurement data by a union of surface patches that can “easily” be built.
> - These surfaces include ruled surfaces, developable surfaces, and other kinematically generated surfaces.
> - Approximation with ruled surfaces.
> - Developable surfaces.
