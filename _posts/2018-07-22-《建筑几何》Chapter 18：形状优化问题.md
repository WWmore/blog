### Shape optimization problems
> - The realization of a design idea in an optimal way, both from the aesthetic and functional perspective, is a difficult and complex problem area.

### Remarks on mathematical optimization 数学优化注解
> - **Any optimum is only an optimum within the conceptualization of the problem space and the boundary conditions applied.**

> - Gradient descent. \\
We form the gradient ∇f = (fx ,fy), which is the vector whose coordinates are the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y.\\
To move “downhill” toward a minimum one may always move in the direction of the negative gradient –∇f.

### Geometric optimization 几何优化
> - Minimal surfaces\\
Given a smooth closed curve c without self-intersections, find the surface patch with boundary curve c that has the smallest surface area A.

> -  A minimal surface has vanishing mean curvature in each of its points. 极小曲面的平均曲率为0
> - a generic surface point p of a minimal surface must be a hyperbolic point (saddle-like) 极小曲面点是双曲点
> - This is a hyperbolic paraboloid whose rulings in the plane z = 0 are the two orthogonal straight lines x + y = 0 and x – y = 0. These straight lines are the asymptotic directions (directions of vanishing normal curvature). 平面z=0与双曲抛物面相交的是两条正交直线rulings，是渐近线
> - in each point of a minimal surface the asymptotic directions are orthogonal. 极小曲面的每个点，渐近方向正交
> -  the bisecting lines of the (always orthogonal) principal directions are the asymptotic directions. 主法曲率线的对角线是渐近方向
> -  on a minimal surface the asymptotic curves form an orthogonal curve network. It is the bisecting curve network of the network of principal curvature lines. 极小曲面，渐近线网是正交网，也是对分正交的主法曲率网得到的

> - For a minimal surface, the asymptotic curve network is also mapped to an orthogonal curve network of S*. This is a result of the remarkable property that the Gaussian spherical mapping of a minimal surface S to the unit sphere S* is conformal (angle preserving). 极小曲面的高斯球像是共形映射（保角），因此正交的渐近网的高斯像也是正交的

> - Willmore energy.\\
Willmore energy is the surface integral of the function $(k_1 – k_2)^2$:
$$E_W = ∫S(k_1 – k_2)^2dA.$$
> - Willmore energy tries to make surfaces as spherical as possible.
> - An important advantage of the Willmore energy is that one can prescribe a boundary strip (i.e., a boundary curve plus tangent planes along it) and compute an energy minimizer that interpolates these data.

> - Fair curves and polygons. \\
The bending energy of an idealized thin elastic beam is proportional to the integral of the squared curvature, expressed as
$E=∫c k^2 ds.$ 用$Es = (1/4) ∑(v_{k-1} + v_{k+1} – 2v_k)^2$替代求解.
