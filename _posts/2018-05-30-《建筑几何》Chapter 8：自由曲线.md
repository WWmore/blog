### Freeform curves 自由曲线

### Bezier Curves
-  To generate a point on a Bézier curve with $n$ control points, we have to perform $n – 1$ steps of the de Casteljau algorithm. $n$个控制顶点，$n-1$次曲线，需要$n-1$次算法

- 局限：\\
1. A Bézier curve with a large number of control points becomes impractical for design. The degree of the curve increases and the curve shape resembles less the shape of the control polygon. \\
2. The control points have global control on the shape of the curve.

### B-spline Curves
- The B stands for “basis.”
- We can also use the B as a mnemonic to remember that a B-spline curve consists of several Bézier curve segments.
- Defining a B-spline curve. A B-spline curve is defined by\\
> • $m + 1$ control points,\\
> • the degree $n,$ and\\
> • the knot vector.\\

- B-spline curve of degree $n$ with $m + 1$ control points $d_0, d_1, ... d_m$ consists of $m + 1 – n$ Bézier curve segments of degree $n$.
- The maximum degree achievable is $n = m$, for which the B-spline curve is actually a Bézier curve to the same control polygon.

- The human eye is able to detect kinks (because the curve tangents change abruptly) and curvature discontinuities (because the curvature changes abruptly).  For cubic B-spline curves, we inherently achieve smooth tangents and smooth curvature at the knot points where the separate curve segments are joined.

- B-spline curves 缺点： With B-spline curves, we are not able to represent such simple curves as a circle, an ellipse, or a hyperbola.

### NURBS Curves
- NURBS curves are B-spline curves with a nonuniform knot vector.

- Connection between B-spline curves and NURBS curves: a planar NURBS curve is a central projection of a spatial B-spline curve.
-  In addition, a spatial NURBS curve is a central projection of B-spline curve lying in a 4D space.
-  A B-spline curve is a special NURBS curve wherein all weights are equal.

### Subdivision curves 细分曲线
-  **Chaikin’s algorithm** for the generation of quadratic B-splines.

- **The Lane-Riesenfeld algorithm** is a generalization of Chaikin’s algorithm that produces in the limit a uniform B-spline curve of degree n.

- **The four-point scheme of Dubuc**. Formally, the new point is computed as
> $p_i^{new} = –1/16 p_{i-1} + 9/16 p_i + 9/16 p_{i+1} – 1/16 p_{i+2}.$

<img src="/images/posts/AG/Dubuc1.png" height="244" width="783">  

- One year later, Dyn et al. (1987) **generalized the four-point scheme** as follows.
> $p_i^{new} = –w∙p_{i-1} + (1/2 + w)∙p_i + (1/2 + w)∙p_{i+1} – w∙p_{i+2}.$

For w = 1/16 we have the original four-point scheme.
