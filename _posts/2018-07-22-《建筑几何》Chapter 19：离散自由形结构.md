### Triangle meshes 三角网格
Aesthetics is greatly enhanced if the mesh can be decomposed into three families of fair polygons (structure lines).

Pick a curve c in the network and compute in each of its points the tangent to the curve from the other family. Then, these tangents must form a developable ruled surface.\\
A network of curves resulting by translation is another simple example of a conjugate curve network.\\
It carries infinitely many conjugate curve networks!

if the input mesh has been extracted from a **conjugate curve network** chances are high that the optimization will not get stuck in an undesirable solution and thus may yield a practically useful result

> - We call two meshes M, M* **parallel** if there is a one-to-one correspondence among their vertices, edges, and faces (such meshes are called combinatorially equivalent) and if corresponding edges are parallel.
> - any mesh parallel to a PQ mesh is also a PQ mesh.

> - Requiring that the node axes be roughly orthogonal to the underlying design surface implies that the mesh M has planar or spherical shape. For a general freeform triangle mesh M, there is no chance to construct a practically useful support structure with torsion-free nodes.

### Offset meshes 等距网格
> - Offset surfaces revisited. \\
Note that the normals of F are normals of F d as well\\
The tangent planes at corresponding points of F and F d are parallel and at constant distance d.
> - PQ meshes with exact offsets. \\
 An offset mesh Md of a PQ mesh M is parallel to M and lies at constant distance d to M.
 > - **Vertex offsets**: The distance of corresponding vertices of M and Md has a constant value d, which does not depend on the vertex.\\
 Md is a vertex offset of M if and only if the vertices of the Gaussian image mesh S are contained in the unit sphere S*. In this case, M and Md are **circular meshes** (i.e., each face has a circum-circle).
 > - **Edge offsets**: The distance of corresponding parallel edges of M and Md (actually, lines that carry these edges) does not depend on the edge and equals d.\\
  Md is an edge offset of M exactly if the edges of the Gaussian image mesh S are tangent to the unit sphere S*.
 > - **Face offsets**: The distance of corresponding faces of M and Md (actually, the parallel planes of corresponding faces) is independent of the face and equals d.\\
 Md is a face offset of M if and only if the faces of the Gaussian image mesh S are tangent to the unit sphere S*. In this case, M and Md are **conical meshes**.

 cone condition at a vertex: The sum of opposite edge angles must be equal: $ω_1 + ω_3 = ω_2 +ω_4.$\\
 This angle balance condition may also be seen as a discrete condition for orthogonality of the two mesh polygons passing through a vertex.\\
  Because conical meshes are orthogonal and conjugate in a discrete sense, conical meshes are a discrete version of the network of principal curvature lines on a smooth surface.
