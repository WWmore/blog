### Deformation 变形

### Three-Dimensional Transformations 3D变换
> - Affine maps 仿射映射：\\
1. 直线映射成直线
2. 平面映射成平面
3. 保直线和平面的平行性
4. 不改变共线点比例
> - Projective maps 射影映射：\\
1. 直线映射成直线
2. 平面映射成平面
3. linear functions **[f = (f0 + f1x + f2y + f3z)/D]** with a common denominator D = d0 + d1x + d2y + d3z.  if d1 = d2 = d3 = 0 (d0 ≠ 0) we have an affine map. Otherwise, d0 + d1x + d2y + d3z = 0 determines a plane V whose points are mapped to points at infinity.
> -  Nonlinear transformations\\
not all straight lines are mapped to straight lines

### Twisting 扭曲
> The bottom plane B remains fixed and the rotational angle αmax of the top plane T is prescribed. We assume that the distance between the bottom and top planes is h, the height of the object to be deformed. The rotational angle α(z) of the slice at height z above B is selected to be
**α(z) = (z/h) α_{max}**.

> - interesting property of the twist operation is that it **preserves the volume**.

### Tapering (~scaling)
> - We select a reference plane B (say, the bottom plane) and an orthogonal axis A.
> - All points of B and all points of A remain fixed under tapering.
> - One then changes the object by scaling the slices in planes orthogonal to A (i.e., parallel to B).
> - Tapering is not a linear transformation. It is a special quadratic transformation.

> - **Bulge**. If one wants to have thickening or thinning effects without loss of smoothness, one can use a deformation technique sometimes called bulge.

### Shear Deformations
> - Shear deformations apply translations to the slices

> - shear transformations are therefore volume preserving.

### Bending 弯曲
> - bending deformations that also change the orientation of the slices.

### Freeform Deformations 自由形变换
> - Planar Bézier deformations of degree (1,1).

### Inversions 倒置
> - The inversion with respect to a sphere maps\\
(a) straight lines to circles through the center o and\\
(b) planes P to spheres P1 through o. \\
(c) Spheres (which do not pass through o) are mapped to spheres and circles (not through o) are mapped to circles.

### Three-Dimensional Textures 3D纹理
> - One views a three-dimensional texture as a topographic surface [i.e., the graph surface of a height field, which associates to each point p1 of a surface S1 a height h(p1) of the texture].
