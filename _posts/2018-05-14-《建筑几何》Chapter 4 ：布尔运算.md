### Union, difference and intersection 并+差+交

- The set that contains all points of set A and all points of set B, but nothing
else, is called the union of A and B.
- The intersection of A and B is defined as the set of all points that belong both
to A and to B.
- The difference of A and B contains only those points of A that do not lie in
B. Analogously, the difference of B and A consists of points of B that are not
contained in A.

### Trim and split 修剪+裂开

- Boolean operations do not work when surfaces are involved
- When it comes to modeling with surfaces, we use the techniques of trimming and
splitting.
