# Bezier Surfaces
<img src="/images/posts/AG/bezier surface.png" height="558" width="800">
### Translational Bézier surfaces：
> - Each boundary polygon of the control mesh defines a Bézier curve that is a boundary curve of the designed Bézier surface patch. Bezier曲面的边界是Bezier曲线.
> - The boundary polygons are the only row and column polygons that define curves on the surface. 内部控制多边形生成的Bezier曲线，不一定在曲面上，除非是translational bezier 曲面:

### Bézier surfaces of degree (1,1)：
> -  $r_0 = (1 – v)b_{00} + v b_{01} $
> - $r_1 = (1 – v)b_{10} + vb_{11}$
> - $b(u,v) = (1 – u)(1 – v)b_{00} + (1 – u)vb_{01} + u(1 – v)b_{10} + uvb_{11}$
> - This shows that the surface is (part of ) a hyperbolic paraboloid (or part of a plane if the control quad is planar).

### Bézier surfaces that are also ruled surfaces：
> Consider a Bézier surface of degree $(1,n)$. Its u-curves are Bézier curves of degree 1 and therefore straight line segments. Therefore, this surface is a ruled surface—spanning two Bézier curves of degree $n$.

> - Open mode for u- and v-curves: the surface is a four-sided patch.
> - Closed mode in one direction (u or v), open mode in the other direction:
such a surface looks like a deformed piece of a pipe.
> - Closed mode in both directions: the surface looks like a deformed torus.

### Interpolating spline surfaces:
> This interpolation problem in its most general form is difficult to solve. However, the following solution is easy and is implemented in most 3D modelers: Given a set of points, arranged like the control points in a quadrilateral mesh, pass a B-spline surface through it.

# Meshes
<img src="/images/posts/AG/mur island.png" height="240" width="350">
> - Roughly speaking, a **mesh** is a collection of points (vertices) arranged into basic elements called **faces**.
> - The faces are bounded by **polygons**. Typically, one type of polygon dominates (e.g., triangle, quadrilateral, or even hexagon).

<img src="/images/posts/AG/meshes.png" height="375" width="800">

### Geometry and connectivity:
> - first discuss their **connectivity**—also refered to as their **“mesh topology.”**
### Quadrilateral meshes:
> In a quad mesh, an interior vertex of valence 4 is called a regular vertex. If the valence is different from four, we talk about an irregular vertex.

### Triangle meshes:
> - Triangle meshes are well suited for architecture because their faces are planar.
> - we may roughly need twice as many triangles as quads to represent the same shape

### Hexagonal meshes:

### Mesh refinement:
It is useful to think about refinement as a two-step procedure:
> - change the connectivity (number of vertices and the way they are connected)
> - and then change the geometry (the position of the vertices).

### Mesh decimation

### Aesthetics of meshes and relaxation:
> - One basic idea is to adjust all mesh vertices so that the resulting mesh consists of nearly regular faces only.
> - A related idea is a physical interpretation using a so-called **mass-spring simulation system**.
> - one implements the vertices as mass points and the edges as springs.
> - Then, one fixes some points (e.g., all boundary vertices) and lets the other vertices move freely until the entire system achieves an equilibrium .
> -This technique is called **relaxation**.
