### Visualization and analysis of shapes
> - certain undesirable effects (such as small bumps) may only be seen from a particular perspective under special lighting conditions.
> - Here, curvature of surfaces comes into play.
> - In fact, the judgment of a shape as visually pleasing depends largely on the way in which **curvature varies** along the surface.

### Curvature of surfaces 曲面的曲率
#### osculating parabola
$$g (x) = f (a) + f '(a)(x – a) + 1⁄2 f ''(a)(x – a)^2.$$

#### Classification of surface points.
1. Elliptic surface point
2. Hyperbolic surface point.
3. Parabolic surface point.
4. Flat point.

#### Gaussian Curvature
> -  Gaussian curvature measures the local area distortion under the Gaussian spherical mapping.
> -  Gaussian curvature is preserved under isometric mappings.
> -  there is no distortion-free map of the earth.
> -  an isometric mapping S → S1 also **preserves the intersection angles** between curves. Moreover, it **preserves surface areas**: a domain B in S and its corresponding domain B1 in S1 have the same surface area.
> -  an angle-preserving mapping (also called **conformal mapping**) need not be an isometric one.
> - In fact, there are many angle-preserving maps between any pair of surfaces.  e, there are many area-preserving mappings.
> -  Frequently used mappings of the earth are either angle preserving or area preserving. However, they cannot have both properties because preservation of both angles and areas implies an isometric mapping.

#### Mean Curvature
> - Mean curvature H = (k1 + k2)/2, the arithmetic mean of the principal curvatures. Surfaces with vanishing mean curvature are minimal surfaces, which appear (for example) as shapes of soap films through a closed wire.

#### principal curvature lines
> - A principal curvature line is a curve on a surface whose tangents are in principal direction.
> - through each general point of a surface there are two principal curvature lines that intersect at a right angle and touch the principal directions.
> -  Principal curvature lines or related networks of curves are sometimes used for the generation of surface illustrations that aim at results that are similar to drawings made by artists.

#### umbilics
> - The principal directions are uniquely defined only if k1 and k2 are different. For k1 = k2, we have a special surface point called an umbilic.
> - the osculating paraboloid P is a paraboloid of revolution or a plane (k1 = k2 = 0).
> - A sphere S (radius R) has only umbilics.
> - At an umbilic, we have the same curvature behavior as for a sphere or a plane; in the latter case we also speak of a flat point.
> - At an umbilic the network of principal curvature lines has a singularity.

### Optical lines for quality control 针对质量可控的光线
> - A surface p(u,v) with continuous first derivatives leads to a reflection line that has continuous positions but may have tangent discontinuities.

#### Isophotes 等照度
> -  These are isophotes, whose definition also depends on the surface normals.
> - A curve c on S along which the surface normals form a constant angle α with v is called an isophote.

#### Contour generators
> - At each point p of c, there is a line r parallel to v and normal to the surface normal (i.e., r is tangent to the surface).

#### Optical lines for shape analysis

> - Surfaces con- structed with the subdivison algorithms of Doo-Sabin, Catmull-Clark or Loop are not curvature continuous at irregu- lar vertices of the input mesh.

 In any case, we have to note that if we want to have smooth mirror images of smooth curves the mirror surface S must be **curvature continuous**. For a B-spline surface, this is achieved by using degree 3 or higher in both parameter directions.

### Digital elevation models 数字演化模型
> - Placing an architectural design within its environmental context is useful and interesting for purposes of visualization and presentation, and can be essential for the actual construction
<img src="/images/posts/AG/gridshell.png" height="250" width="400">
> - two frequently used representations of topographic surfaces in digital elevation models: a **grid-based approach** and a **triangulation**.

> - Assuming a smooth surface, the orthogonal network of level curves and curves of steepest descent is singular at critical points. These are defined as points with a horizontal tangent plane.

> - If the polyhedron is topologically equivalent to a sphere, **Euler’s formula** holds: **v – e + f = 2**.
> - the Euler characteristic for a surface topologically equivalent to a **torus** is zero: **v – e + f = 0**.
> -  χ = **v–e+f = 1** for a **Möbius band**.

#### Classification of closed orientable surfaces
> - any closed orientable surface S is equivalent to a sphere with a certain number g of handles. This number is called the **topological genus** of S. A sphere has genus g = 0, and a torus has genus g = 1. The Euler characteristic χ of a surface with genus g equals
**χ = v – e + f = 2 – 2g.**
